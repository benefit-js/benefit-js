> Congratulations! You just found the *easiest* way to integrate with the BENEFIT payment system in Bahrain!

## üëã About

BenefitJS¬π is a simple, open-source library that allows you to accept BENEFIT payments through a modern, reliable interface that is optimized around the User Experience. 

It was born out of a frustration with the verbose, cryptic and unappealing integration process that comes standard with BENEFIT integrations.

BenefitJS provides:
- üì± A stunning **mobile-first** user experience that massively improves upon the default Benefit integration
- üôå **Same-page checkout** (finally!) using a sleek, modern modal dialog
- üòç Additional features, including support for one-click checkout (or "Tokenization", in payments lingo)
- üìß **Premium support**, available to Enterprise customers (more [below](#-premium-support))

## üëâ How it looks

This is what the default (and rather distasteful) Benefit integration looks like:

![Benefit - Before](./assets/benefit-before.png)

.. and here's what the BenefitJS checkout page looks like:

![Benefit - After](./assets/benefit-after.png)

## ‚ö° Getting Started

This project consists of two main parts:

1. An `index.js` that creates an `<iframe>` in the parent window, or opens a separate window on mobile devices.
2. Checkout, a Vue application with the actual Checkout form, is added as a submodule at [`inner/`](https://github.com/benefit-js/inner/tree/). 

Since the two projects are tightly coupled, we track them jointly through this repository.

### Using Benefit.js

To integrate using Benefit.js, you'll need an account with BENEFIT. If you don't already have one, [sign up for a BENEFIT account through Credimax](https://www.credimax.com.bh/en/e_payment_gateway)

Assuming you have an account, you can now:

1. Register for a BenefitJS account at [https://benefitjs.com](https://benefitjs.com/?utm_source=github)
2. Upload your `resource.cgn` file to the Dashboard, and receive your public key.
3. Integrate BenefitJS into your website using the sample code below:

```html
<form action="/pay" method="POST">
  <script 
    src="https://fast.benefitjs.com"
    data-key="key_..."
    data-transaction-id="19201"
    data-amount="12.345">
  </script>
  <!-- renders 'pay' button, submits form when done -->
</form>
```

<details>
<summary>Interested in more finer-grained control of the checkout? Then <strong>custom mode is for you!</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space:nowrap">
const benefitHandler = new BenefitJS({
  key: 'key_...',
  transactionId: 'Order 12910',
  amount: 1.234, // BHD
  onClose: () => {
    console.warn('onClose() called')
  },
  onCancel: () => {
    console.warn('onCancel() called')
  },
  onComplete: () => {
    console.info('onComplete() called')
  }
})
</pre>
</details>

For a complete list of `data-` params, see the [Supported options](#supported-options) section below.

### First-time local setup

1. Create a `.env.development` file with the following keys:
    - `CHECKOUT_URL=http://localhost:8080`, or whatever the local server URL is for your [`inner`](https://github.com/benefit-js/benefit-js) repository
    - `DEBUG_MODE=true`, to enable debug messages in the browser console
2. Run `yarn run serve`

This should open up the `demo.html` file in your browser. Editing the `index.js` script should automagically reload your browser and keep things in sync!

To update to the latest version of `inner`, simply run `git submodule update --remote` from the `inner/` directory.

### Deployment

The wrapper `index.js` script is deployed to `https://fast.benefitjs.com/benefit.js`, our global static CDN-hosted endpoint. 

Checkout is deployed at a separate endpoint at `https://checkout.benefitjs.com/`.

## Supported Options

Below is a comprehensive list of the common options supported by the BenefitJS library for both integration types (simple and custom):

| Key | Required? | Description | Sample |
|---|---|:--|:--|
| `key` / `data-key` | **Required** | The public key that uniquely identifies you as a seller. You can get this key from the [BenefitJS dashboard](https://benefitjs.com) | `89b51c9e-9338-11e9-9cc3-0242ac110003` |
| `transactionId` / `data-transaction-id` | **Required** | Any unique character sequence that can be used to identify this order. Usually something your backend generates | `Order-1234` |
| `amount` / `data-amount` | **Required** | The amount that the customer will pay for the order, in BHD. This is a decimal value | `1.234` *= BHD 1.234* |
| `title` / `data-title` | *optional* | The title shown on top of the payment page. Great place to put the seller name | `Batelco`. Default is `Pay with BENEFIT` |
| `subtitle` / `data-subtitle` | *optional* | Displayed directly under the title on the payment page. Great place to include a description of the items being purchased. |  `Bill payment for 3999 9999`. Default is ` ` (empty) |

### Simple-only options

The options below are only supported by the Simple integration:

| Option | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---| 
| `data-button-text` | *optional* | The text shown on the "Pay Now" button that is generated. Defaults to `Pay by Debit Card` |

### Custom-only options

The Custom integration supports the following callbacks:

| Option | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---| 
| `onCancel` | *optional* | Function that is called when the payment dialog is cancelled by the user.
| `onComplete` | *optional* | Function that is called when the payment is successfully completed.
| `onClose` | *optional* | The function that is called when the modal dialog is closed. This is **always** triggered on modal close, regardless of the underlying reason (e.g. user cancellation or payment completion).
